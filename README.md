* `manual_filtering.xlsx`: Contains the results of manually classifying the papers identified by querying **Scopus** using the search queries listed in Table 1 (Section 3.1) of the study. Each paper was categorized into one of four groups:                             *Strictly Relevant*, *Relevant*, *Inaccessible* and *Not Relevant*, based on its content and accessibility. The file uses color coding for clarity: **green** for *Strictly Relevant*, **white** for *Relevant*,                                 **grey** for *Inaccessible* and **red** for *Not Relevant* papers.

* `Duplicates.xlsx`: Contains the duplicate papers identified when querying **Scopus** using the search queries listed in Table 1 (Section 3.1) of the study. Duplicates are highlighted in **yellow**.
